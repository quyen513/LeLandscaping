# Goal is Build Landscaping Client Management (LCM) Website and Test LCM

- Phase one: wireframe, website skeleton, AWS and Dbeaver PostgreSQL Database, basic funtional
- Phase two: add CSS, advance function: google maps, address routes
- Phase three (Tesing-phase): part of this phase, such as Junit, Mockito testing are done during Phase one and Two; therefore, at current stage, should focus on E2E test with Cucumber and Selenium as well as make sure all the Unit and Service tests are working as intended.

#Technology:
  - UI
    - HTML: the backbone of our webpages
    - CSS: styles our webpages
    - JavaScript: helps add dynamic features to our UI, methods to work with API
- SQL
    - AWS (RDS: PostgreSQL, follow up on Elastic Beanstalk): remote database
    - DBeaver: database application
- Java
    - Hibernate: uses object-relational mapping to connect Java code with our SQL database
    - Unit Testing
        - Mockito: can create mock objects so we can run service tests without affecting our database
    - Integration Testing
        - Javalin: supports HTTP requests
        - Postman: controls API functions
    - E2E Testing
        - Cucumber-Junit: testing framework that integrates with Cucumber
        - Cucumber: testing framework to run acceptance criteria into executable steps
    - Selenium
        - Browser automation tool
- Workspace
    - Github: 
    - Github Actions:
